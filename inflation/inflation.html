A price indexis constructed by dividing the price ofa market basket in a given year by the price ofthe same basketofgoods in a base year.The rate ofinflation is then measuredby calculating the percentagechange in the price indexacross different periods. Forexample,the CPI was about 257in November 2019 and about260in November2020, which amounts to an inflation rate ofabout 1.2% overthis 12-month period. </p><Sect path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;"><h2 path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/H2" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">Alternative Measures of Inflation </h2><p path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Alternativeprice indices will use different goods within theirmarket baskets andare generally usedfor different purposes. Forexample, the CPI includes consumergoods and services typically purchasedby households, which is often used to adjust household incomes forinflation over time. By contrast, thegross domestic product(GDP) deflator, which is generally usedto adjust GDP for inflation overtime, measures inflation for allof the finalgoods and services producedin the UnitedStates. There are a number of additionalmeasures ofinflation,including the Producer Price Index, Employment Cost Index,Personal ConsumptionExpenditures Index, and Import/Export Price Index. Different inflation measures are calculated differently.Forexample, the CPI uses a (mostly)fixed basket of goods and services, whereas the GDP deflator allows the compositionofits market basketto change with spendingpatterns fromperiod to period. </p><p path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;"><ParagraphSpan path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Additionally,within a specific price index, researchers often make separate calculations forso-called <Span path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan/Span" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PS;">headline inflation </Span><ParagraphSpan path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">and </ParagraphSpan><Span path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan/Span[2]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PS;">core inflation </Span><ParagraphSpan path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">, as seenin </ParagraphSpan><ParagraphSpan path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">.Headline </ParagraphSpan></ParagraphSpan><ParagraphSpan path="Document/Sect[3]/Sect/P[2]/ParagraphSpan[2]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">inflation includes the fullset ofgoods and services within the basketofgoods, whereas core inflationexcludes energy and food prices fromthe basket of goods. Core inflation is often used byresearchers in place ofheadline inflation due to the volatile nature ofthe price offood andenergy.

However,in reality, this is nearly impossible fortwo reasons. First, the quality ofgoods and services change over time. As such, some portionofincreasingprices overtime is due to improvements in quality rather than inflation. Second, newproducts are introducedinto the marketplace overtime that are fundamentally differentthanany previously available products andare only slowly incorporatedinto price indices with fixed baskets. Statisticalagencies try toadjustdatato accountfor these factors,because, ifthese complications are notcorrectly accounted for, measured inflationwouldbe inaccurate and most likely overstated. </p></Sect></Sect><Sect path="Document/Sect[4]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;"><h1 path="Document/Sect[4]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">Causes of Inflation </h1><p path="Document/Sect[4]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Inflation is largely the result oftwo differentphenomena, which are often referred to as <Span path="Document/Sect[4]/P/Span" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PS;">demand-pull </Span><p_ path="Document/Sect[4]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">and</p_><Span path="Document/Sect[4]/P/Span[2]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PS;">cost-push  </Span><p_ path="Document/Sect[4]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">inflation.

The classic example of cost-push </ParagraphSpan><ParagraphSpan path="Document/Sect[4]/P[2]/ParagraphSpan[2]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">inflation is the result ofan oilshock,which sharply decreases thesupply of oiland otherpetroleumproducts. The decrease in oilsupplies increases theprice ofoiland petroleumproducts. Petroleumproducts are an input good for a significant portionofgoods andservices across the economy, andas theprice ofthis important input good increases, sodoes the price ofthe finalgoods andservices, resulting in inflation. Cost-pushinflation results in only a temporary increase in inflation unless accommodatedby monetary policy. </ParagraphSpan></p><p path="Document/Sect[4]/P[3]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Changes in inflation expectations can also cause changes in actualinflation.Individuals formexpectations around the future rate ofinflation and incorporate those expectations when setting prices at the firm levelor when bargaining for wages as a worker. Forexample, if the generalconsensus is that prices willincrease 2% in the next year, businesses will want to increaseprices by at least2%,and workers will want at least a 2% raise. </p></Sect><Sect path="Document/Sect[5]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;"><h1 path="Document/Sect[5]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;"><Span path="Document/Sect[5]/H1/Span" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">In </Span><h1_ path="Document/Sect[5]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">flation&#8217;</h1_><ExtraCharSpan path="Document/Sect[5]/H1/ExtraCharSpan" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">s </ExtraCharSpan><h1_ path="Document/Sect[5]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">Impac</h1_><ExtraCharSpan path="Document/Sect[5]/H1/ExtraCharSpan[2]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">t </ExtraCharSpan><h1_ path="Document/Sect[5]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">o</h1_><ExtraCharSpan path="Document/Sect[5]/H1/ExtraCharSpan[3]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">n </ExtraCharSpan><h1_ path="Document/Sect[5]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">th</h1_><ExtraCharSpan path="Document/Sect[5]/H1/ExtraCharSpan[4]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">e </ExtraCharSpan><h1_ path="Document/Sect[5]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">Econom</h1_><ExtraCharSpan path="Document/Sect[5]/H1/ExtraCharSpan[5]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">y </ExtraCharSpan></h1><p path="Document/Sect[5]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Inflation tends to interfere with pricing mechanisms in the economy, resultingin individuals and businesses making less than optimalspending, saving, andinvestment decisions. Additionally, in the presenceofinflation, economic actors oftenengage in actions to protect themselves fromthe negative impacts ofinflation, diverting resources fromothermore productive activities. </p><p path="Document/Sect[5]/P[2]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Ultimately, these inefficient decisions reduce incomes, economic growth,and living standards.Forthis reason, it is generally acceptedthatinflation should be kept lowto minimize these distortions in the economy. Some would argue that an inflationrate ofzero is optimal. However, a target ofzero inflation makes a period ofaccidental deflation more likely, and deflation is thought tobe even more costly thaninflation, as it can be associated with recessionary conditions. In an effort to balancethesetwo risks, policymakers, including theFederalReserve,often target a positive but lowinflation rate, generally around 2%, which reduces inefficiencies within the economy while protecting againstdeflation. </p></Sect><Sect path="Document/Sect[6]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;"><h1 path="Document/Sect[6]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">The Federal Reserve and Inflation </h1><p path="Document/Sect[6]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">The FederalReserve has beencharged with promoting stable prices by statute sincethe late 1970s, largely as a result ofthe volatile and exceptionally highinflation experienced duringthe 1970s, as shownin <p_ path="Document/Sect[6]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">. Beginning in 2012, the FederalReserve began explicitly targeting a long-runinflation rate of2%.

Beginningin the late 1990s, the inflation rate remains relatively close to 2%, and the large swings in inflation, such as those seenduring the1970s,mostly disappear.

Inflation has run below2% fairly consistently since the financialcrisis, despite several notable periods ofquantitative easing and an 11-year expansion that ended in 2020. In response to thecurrent recession, the FederalReserve has indicated that it will keep the federalfunds at nearzero levels forthe foreseeable future, which, all else being equal, would stimulate economic activityand causeinflation to increase. </p></Sect><Sect path="Document/Sect[7]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;"><h1 path="Document/Sect[7]/H1" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">Adjusting for Inflation </h1><p path="Document/Sect[7]/P" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT;">Comparing figures in realterms is often beneficialto observe actualchanges in purchasingpowerovertime ratherthan changes in the numberofdollars. </p><p path="Document/Sect[7]/P[2]" style="font-weight:700;font-family:Gill Sans MT;">Figure 2.
