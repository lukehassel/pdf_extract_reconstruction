    to poverty reduction and could undo decades of development efforts. While climate change is global, its negative
    impacts are more severely felt by poor people and poor countries. They are more vulnerable because of their high
    dependence on natural resources and limited capacity to cope with climate variability and extremes. Restoring and
    maintaining key ecosystems can help communities in their adaptation efforts and support livelihoods that depend upon

    The economic impact of drought, floods and other climate change effects will become quite substantial. Some

        Another adaptive solution is learning to live with floods. Instead of concentrating on reinforcing the
        protecting areas (dunes and dikes) we rather put our efforts in limiting the consequences. This too will reduce
        the risk. After all, risk is defined as opportunity x consequence. If the opportunity remains the same, but the
        consequences are less severe, the risk will decrease. And exactly the limiting of the consequences can be
        started off on local government level. You could think of local policies like &#8226;no constructions in lower
        areas of the country&#8226; or on the contrary &#8226;specially adapted constructions in lower areas of the

        February the Chinese government launched a plan to reclaim 250.000 square kilome-tres from the desert by 2020 by
        means of planting trees and grass. Also, the Chinese government wants to invest in dry regions in the efficient
        use of water and renewable energy sources, such as wind and water. Furthermore it is the opinion of the
        UN-Environmental organization (UNEP) that where it is difficult to turn the tide, one should make a virtue of
        necessity. The story of a report that was published 5 June ran as: &#8226;As long as deserts become more
        inhospitable and less suitable for human habitation, we must be imaginative and take advantage of the new
        situation&#8226;. UNEP sees an important potential particularly for the exploitation of solar energy,
        fish-production, research of the medicinal properties of desert plants and the breeding of crops resistant to
        drought and salinity. Also, new technologies to develop more efficient irrigation systems and to desalinate estu

                rise caused by climate change can in extreme situations (heat) have a direct negative impact on the
                human health. Possible health effects in Europe are: problems by heat stress, increase of the spreading
                of Lyme&#8226;s disease, effects of bad air quality (summer smog) and an increase of allergies.

<p path="Document/P[52]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT">Climate change is happening and
    it is caused largely by human activity. Its impacts are beginning to be felt and will be worsen in the decades ahead
    unless we take action. The increasing rate of global warming&#8226;courtesy of carbon dioxide and other green house
    gas emissions from human activities&#8226;have led to climatic changes and environmental degradation, which in turn
    have resulted to great challenges in relation to diseases and human health. Many diseases which were previously
    unknown in certain climatic zones are now finding their way to such areas, due to changes in the weather conditions.
    Further, many diseases that had been thought extinct are reemerging in areas with altered climatic conditions that
    favor their comeback. It is therefore important that stakeholders and decision makers at industrial, government and
    international policy levels come up with strin
    <p_ path="Document/P[52]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT">gent and workable means of
        cutting down on green house gases emission to combat the spread of global warm
    </p_>
    <p_ path="Document/P[52]" style="font-weight:400;font-family:Titlingmes New Roman PSMT">ing effects, and the
        resultant climate change, which has produced devastating impacts especially among poorer nations. Further, there
        should be increased funding of adaptation and coping programs and projects in affected areas to minimize the
        impacts on human health and curtail the spread of diseases.
